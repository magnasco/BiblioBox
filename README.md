# BiblioBox
tl;dr: federated embedded hyperlocal webstack

BiblioBox is a free and open source software stack that runs a full web server, multi-user library server, and a complete programming IDE... off a pen drive! Plug it into a router or a Raspberry Pi and an entire office or classroom can work together, even with dial-up or no internet connection.

FOR: Nonprofits, journalists and educational institutions, in remote areas and conflict zones, with minimal resources. Makerspaces/hackerspaces. Mobile research stations. Boats. Bookmobiles. Satellite connection cybercafes. Protests & sit-ins.
