# BiblioBox
tl;dr router-based full workstation

BiblioBox is a software stack that runs a full web server, a full multi-user library server, and a complete research station and programming IDE... off a router!

Plug it into any router or Raspberry Pi and an entire office or classroom can work together, even with dial-up or no internet connection. BiblioBox was designed for team use by nonprofits and educational institutions in remote areas and war zones with minimal resources. Version control through git ensures consistency across instances.
