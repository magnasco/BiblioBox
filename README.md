# BiblioBox
tl;dr: multi-user full workstation on a pen drive
techie tl;dr: federated embedded hyperlocal webstack

BiblioBox is a software stack that runs a full web server, a full multi-user library server, and a complete programming IDE... off a pen drive! Plug it into a router or a Raspberry Pi and an entire office or classroom can work together, even with dial-up or no internet connection. BiblioBox can syncronyze with other instances via git. This was designed for team use by nonprofits and educational institutions in remote areas and war zones with minimal resources.
