# BiblioBox
tl;dr: federated embedded hyperlocal webstack

BiblioBox is a software stack that runs a full web server, a full multi-user library server, and a complete programming IDE... off a pen drive! Plug it into a router or a Raspberry Pi and an entire office or classroom can work together, even with dial-up or no internet connection. BiblioBox can syncronyze with other instances via git.

FOR: Nonprofits, journalists and educational institutions, in remote areas and war zones, with minimal resources. Makerspaces/hackerspaces. Mobile research stations. Boats. Bookmobiles. Satellite connection cybercafes.
