# BiblioBox
tl;dr router-based full workstation

BiblioBox is a free and open source software stack that runs a full web server, a full multi-user library server, and a complete research station and programming IDE... off a router!

Install it on any router or Raspberry Pi and an entire office or classroom can work together, even with dial-up or no internet connection. BiblioBox was designed for team use by nonprofits and educational institutions in remote areas and war zones with minimal resources. Version control through git ensures consistency across instances.

Website under construction -- stay tuned!
